# dotfiles

To install on new machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/KelbyFaessler/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install
```

Then, install zsh if not already installed (can check with `zsh --version`).
For debian/ubuntu systems this can be done with `./install_debian`

NOTES:
- In windows, for the Powerlevel10k zsh theme, you'll have to manually install Meslo Nerd Font (see https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#meslo-nerd-font-patched-for-powerlevel10k)
